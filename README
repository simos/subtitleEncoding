This script aims to detect the encoding of a subtitle file and autoconvert
it to UTF-8.

The aims are:
1. Ability to provide hints to the script (for example, shortlist of encodings
that can be deduced from the LANG variable).
2. Ability to test that the guessed encoding is actually valid.
3. Produce as output a UTF-8 version of the input file.

TODO items: 
* Use Python commands instead of invoking external applications (as much as possible).
* Take hints from http://gomputor.wordpress.com/2008/09/22/convert-a-file-in-utf-8-or-any-encoding-with-python/
* Windows-1253 and iso-8859-7, how can we distinguish?
